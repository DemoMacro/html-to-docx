# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping the TurboDocx html-to-docx project safe.

### Preferred Method

If you find a potential security issue:

1. **Open an issue** in the GitHub repository with as much detail as possible about the vulnerability. If it is very serious, please contact the maintainers directly. 
2. **If you're able**, please open a corresponding pull request with a proposed fix. This greatly helps us accelerate the resolution process.

### What to Expect

We review reports as promptly as possible, but timelines may vary depending on complexity, dependency involvement, or overall project workload. Vulnerabilities that rely on older packages or require more extensive refactoring may take longer than expected to resolve.

If your report contains sensitive information or you're unsure about public disclosure, reach out privately via the contact options in the repository.

Thank you for contributing to the security of the TurboDocx ecosystem.
